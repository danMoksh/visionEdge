# üõ©Ô∏è Autonomous FOD Detection System using VTOL Drone

This project is a real-time Foreign Object Debris (FOD) detection system that uses YOLO ML Model on the server and a VTOL drone for automatic scanning and geo-tagging of debris on runways or racing circuits. Built for accuracy, safety, and automation.

## üîç System Overview

A VTOL drone conducts aerial scans and streams live video to the server. The server uses a trained AI model to detect debris in real-time. If any FOD is found, it marks its location, retrieves precise GPS coordinates from a telemetry module, logs them, and alerts the ground team.

An automatic pick-and-place rover for FOD removal is currently a work in progress.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Components

### Hardware
- **VTOL Drone** ‚Äì Capable of autonomous flight and manual override  
- **GoPro Camera** ‚Äì Mounted on the drone for video capture  
- **VTX / HDMI TX-RX** ‚Äì Transfers live video feed to the server  
- **Telemetry Module** ‚Äì Provides real-time GPS data to the server  
- **RX Remote** ‚Äì Manual control in conflict scenarios  

### Software
- **YOLO/AI Model** ‚Äì Detects FOD in video frames  
- **Server** ‚Äì Processes video, logs coordinates, and alerts ground team  
- **Database** ‚Äì Stores FOD detection data for audit and review  
- **Alerting System** ‚Äì Sends notification and co-ordinates upon detection

## üîÅ Workflow

1. VTOL drone is launched and performs a configured autonomous flight
2. It streams live video to the server via VTX/HDMI TX-RX for low latency
3. The server analyzes each frame using a YOLO model trained for FOD detection
4. If FOD is detected:
   - Marked in video
   - Coordinates retrieved from telemetry module
   - Location logged into database
   - Ground team is alerted instantly
5. If no FOD is detected, drone continues or returns home safely

## üîß Work in Progress

We are currently developing an **autonomous pick-and-place rover** that will work alongside the detection system to **remove detected FODs** from the runway or track in real time.

This rover will:
- Be deployed upon detection confirmation
- Navigate to the marked GPS coordinates
- Pick up FODs using a robotic mechanism
- Work autonomously or via manual override when needed
